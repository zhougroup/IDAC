# Implicit_Distributional_RL
This repo contains code used in the paper *Implicit Distributional Reinforcement Learning* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06159)

The code is implemented upon the *Stable Baselines* RL Benchmark. 

Dependencies are the same as *Stable Baselines* + *Mujoco*. 

To run the experiment, use run_idac.py file.
